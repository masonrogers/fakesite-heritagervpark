	<h2>Masters Week at Heritage</h2>
	<br>
		<p>Thinking about coming to Augusta for Masters 2018?  Heritage RV Park has been proudly catering to Masters Fans for over 10 years.  We are located just 8 miles away from the tournament gates.</p>

		<p><b>Masters Week 2018 at Heritage starts on March 31st, and ends on April 9.</b></p>

		<p>During Masters week, Heritage transforms as over a hundred Masters Fans from across the country make the trip to Augusta, GA.  We have an increase of Masters Fans annually, and it's easy to see why--Heritage becomes a place of community and friendship during Masters Week.  We often see outdoor grilling and BBQ'ing among several campers as people get together and talk about their experiences or day at the tournament.  It's common to see permanent friendships formed here among campers.<p>

		<p>Package A  $400 Includes Sat, Sun, Mon, Tues (Depart Wed morning)<br>Package B  $500 Includes Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun (Depart Mon morning)<br>Package C  $800 Includes Arriving as early as Saturday before Masters and departing 9 days later on Monday morning after Masters. </p>
		<br>
